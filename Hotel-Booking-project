Project Summary -
In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Python to explore and visualize key revenue patterns in hotel bookings. The dataset, sourced from real-world booking records, includes over 30 features related to guest reservations, including booking dates, length of stay, cancellation status, room types, pricing (ADR), and customer behavior. Leveraging the power of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project transforms raw Excel data into meaningful revenue insights to assist hotel management in optimizing strategies, pricing, and resource allocation.

(A) Objectives The primary goal was to extract, process, and visualize revenue-related metrics from historical hotel booking data, with a focus on:

Estimating monthly and annual revenue trends

Comparing revenue between different hotel types (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)

Investigating the impact of lead time, cancellations, and booking durations on revenue

Creating intuitive and professional visualizations for stakeholders

Practicing core data science skills: data cleaning, feature engineering, group analysis, and visual storytelling

(B) Tools & Technologies Used Python: The backbone language for data handling and analysis

Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and grouping

NumPy: For numerical operations such as calculating total revenue

Matplotlib: To create custom, publication-ready charts and graphs

(C) Approach Data Ingestion & Cleaning:

Loaded the Excel sheet (Hotel Bookings) using Pandas.

Checked for and handled null values in critical fields like adr, stays_in_week_nights, and stays_in_weekend_nights.

Filtered out canceled bookings (is_canceled == 0) to focus only on revenue-generating records.

Feature Engineering:

Created a new column total_nights = stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights.

Calculated estimated revenue per booking using: revenue = adr * total_nights

Added a month_year field by combining arrival_date_month and arrival_date_year for time-based grouping.

Revenue Analysis:

Aggregated total revenue by:

Month & Year (to show seasonal and yearly patterns)

Hotel Type (City vs Resort)

Compared revenue distribution by customer type (customer_type) and booking lead time.

Visualization:

Plotted a multi-line graph of monthly revenue across years.

Created bar charts to compare hotel types.

Designed a heatmap (optional) showing revenue correlation with stay duration and booking lead time.

Ensured all charts were clearly labeled, color-coded, and annotated for insights.

(D) Key Findings City Hotels consistently generated higher revenue, especially in the months of July and August.

A longer lead time correlated with higher ADR but didn’t always lead to longer stays.

Bookings with special requests tended to bring in higher revenue — a subtle signal that premium guests tend to personalize.

Revenue dips in early months (Jan–Feb), indicating potential off-season for targeted marketing strategies.

(E) Conclusion & Learnings This project offered a deep dive into real-world data analysis — from raw Excel data to a revenue dashboard packed with actionable insights. It strengthened my understanding of:

Feature engineering in context of business KPIs

Data grouping and aggregation for trend discovery

Visual storytelling to drive decisions

How even basic tools like Pandas and Matplotlib can power full-scale business intelligence

Going forward, this project can evolve into a fully interactive web dashboard using tools like Streamlit or Plotly Dash, or even integrate predictive modeling to forecast future revenue based on historical trends.

1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
Because it shows: 1.When each hotel earns the most 2.Which hotel performs better in which month 3.Super useful for seasonal planning

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
1.Resort Hotels peak in summer (July & August) – likely due to holidays and tourism season.

2.City Hotels show steady revenue year-round, with slight drops in early months (Jan–Feb).

3.Off-season dip is visible for both hotel types during winter months (especially January).

4.City Hotels outperform Resort Hotels in the off-peak months — suggesting more business travel during non-vacation times.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

Yes, the insights gained from the chart can create a positive business impact by helping hotels plan better for high and low seasons. For example, knowing that Resort Hotels peak in revenue during July and August allows management to increase pricing, staff accordingly, and focus marketing efforts during those months. City Hotels, which show consistent revenue, can focus on business travelers year-round. However, if the observed dip in January and February is ignored, it could lead to underutilized resources and missed revenue opportunities. While the insights themselves don’t directly lead to negative growth, failing to act on them or relying too heavily on peak seasons can result in poor performance during off-peak periods.

1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
I chose this chart to understand which customer types cancel most often, as cancellations directly impact revenue and resource planning. By identifying high-risk groups (like "Group" or "Transient-party"), the hotel can take action — such as stricter policies or better follow-up — to reduce cancellations and improve booking reliability.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The chart shows that group and transient-party customers have the highest cancellation rates, while contract customers cancel the least. This means group bookings are less reliable and may need stricter policies.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

the insight helps reduce cancellations by targeting high-risk customer types with stricter policies. If ignored, frequent group cancellations can lead to revenue loss and poor room planning.

picked this chart to find out which market segments bring in the most revenue per room. It helps the hotel focus on the most profitable booking sources and improve pricing or marketing strategies based on where the money comes from.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The chart shows that Corporate and Direct market segments have the highest average daily rates (ADR), meaning they generate more revenue per booking. In contrast, Online Travel Agencies (OTA) bring in a lower ADR, indicating they may drive volume but not high profit per room. This helps the hotel identify which segments are most valuable and where to focus for higher revenue.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

Yes, the insight helps boost profit by focusing on high-ADR segments like Corporate and Direct. Relying too much on low-ADR segments like OTA may hurt revenue despite high bookings.

I picked this chart to find out which countries most guests come from. It helps hotels understand their key markets and focus on targeted marketing, language support, or promotions for those countries to attract more bookings and improve guest experience.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The chart shows that most bookings come from a few countries like Portugal, the UK, and France, meaning these are the hotel’s top markets. This insight helps focus marketing efforts, offer localized services, and build stronger connections with frequent international guests.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

Yes, the insight helps boost business by targeting top countries with marketing and services. But over-reliance on a few countries can be risky if travel drops, so diversifying is important.

1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
I picked this chart to easily see how different numerical features are related to each other. A correlation heatmap helps identify patterns, like which factors are strongly linked to cancellations, revenue, or lead time, so we can focus on the most impactful variables in our analysis or predictions.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The heatmap shows that lead time has a strong positive correlation with cancellations — meaning the longer people wait between booking and arrival, the more likely they are to cancel. Also, total nights stayed and ADR (average daily rate) are positively related to revenue, which makes sense since longer, higher-priced stays bring in more money.

# Pair Plot visualization code
import seaborn as sns

# Basic pair plot with 3 variables
sns.pairplot(df[['lead_time', 'adr', 'is_canceled']])
plt.show()


1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
I picked the pair plot because it shows the relationship between multiple numerical features in one single chart. It helps us quickly spot patterns, trends, or correlations, like how lead time affects cancellations or how ADR relates to booking behavior — all at a glance, without writing multiple plots.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The pair plot shows that higher lead time is often linked to more cancellations, and bookings with higher ADR (room rates) tend to be less likely to cancel. Also, most bookings cluster around lower ADR and lead time, showing typical guest behavior.

5. Solution to Business Objective
What do you suggest the client to achieve Business Objective ?
Explain Briefly.

To help the client achieve their business objective of maximizing revenue and reducing cancellations, I suggest the following:

1.Focus on High-Value Segments

Promote Corporate and Direct bookings, as they have higher ADR and lower cancellation rates. Offer loyalty benefits or flexible check-in for these customers.

2.Reduce Cancellations

Encourage non-refundable bookings with small discounts. Apply stricter policies for customers with high lead times or no special requests (who are more likely to cancel). Use deposit policies wisely to filter unserious bookings.

3.Optimize Seasonal Pricing

Raise prices in peak months (July, August). Offer discounts and bundled packages in off-peak seasons (Jan, Feb) to fill rooms.

4.Target Top Markets

Focus ads and language/localized services in countries with the most bookings (like Portugal, UK). Expand outreach in similar markets to grow.

Conclusion
Through detailed analysis of the hotel booking dataset using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib, we uncovered key insights that can directly impact business decisions. We found that lead time, customer type, deposit policy, and special requests strongly influence booking cancellations. Corporate and direct bookings bring higher revenue, while group and OTA bookings tend to cancel more often. Seasonal trends show peak demand in summer months like July and August, and lower demand in January and February.

By acting on these insights, the hotel can implement smarter pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, target high-value customers, and optimize operations across the year. This data-driven approach lays a strong foundation for improving profitability and guest satisfaction.
