        "In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Python to explore and visualize key revenue patterns in hotel bookings. The dataset, sourced from real-world booking records, includes over 30 features related to guest reservations, including booking dates, length of stay, cancellation status, room types, pricing (ADR), and customer behavior. Leveraging the power of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project transforms raw Excel data into meaningful revenue insights to assist hotel management in optimizing strategies, pricing, and resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "(A) Objectives\n",
        "The primary goal was to extract, process, and visualize revenue-related metrics from historical hotel booking data, with a focus on:\n",
        "\n",
        "Estimating monthly and annual revenue trends\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing revenue between different hotel types (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)\n",
        "\n",
        "Investigating the impact of lead time, cancellations, and booking durations on revenue\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating intuitive and professional visualizations for stakeholders\n",
        "\n",
        "Practicing core data science skills: data cleaning, feature engineering, group analysis, and visual storytelling\n",
        "\n",
        "(B) Tools & Technologies Used\n",
        "Python: The backbone language for data handling and analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and grouping\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy: For numerical operations such as calculating total revenue\n",
        "\n",
        "Matplotlib: To create custom, publication-ready charts and graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "(C) Approach\n",
        "Data Ingestion & Cleaning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Loaded the Excel sheet (Hotel Bookings) using Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Checked for and handled null values in critical fields like adr, stays_in_week_nights, and stays_in_weekend_nights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Filtered out canceled bookings (is_canceled == 0) to focus only on revenue-generating records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Engineering:\n",
        "\n",
        "Created a new column total_nights = stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculated estimated revenue per booking using:\n",
        "revenue = adr * total_nights\n",
        "\n",
        "Added a month_year field by combining arrival_date_month and arrival_date_year for time-based grouping.\n",

        "Revenue Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Aggregated total revenue by:\n",

        "\n",
        "Hotel Type (City vs Resort)\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared revenue distribution by customer type (customer_type) and booking lead time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Plotted a multi-line graph of monthly revenue across years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Created bar charts to compare hotel types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Designed a heatmap (optional) showing revenue correlation with stay duration and booking lead time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensured all charts were clearly labeled, color-coded, and annotated for insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "(D) Key Findings\n",
        "City Hotels consistently generated higher revenue, especially in the months of July and August.\n",
        "\n",
        "A longer lead time correlated with higher ADR but didn’t always lead to longer stays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bookings with special requests tended to bring in higher revenue — a subtle signal that premium guests tend to personalize.\n",
        "\n",
        "Revenue dips in early months (Jan–Feb), indicating potential off-season for targeted marketing strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "(E) Conclusion & Learnings\n",
        "This project offered a deep dive into real-world data analysis — from raw Excel data to a revenue dashboard packed with actionable insights. It strengthened my understanding of:\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering in context of business KPIs\n",
        "\n",
        "Data grouping and aggregation for trend discovery\n",
        "\n",
        "Visual storytelling to drive decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "How even basic tools like Pandas and Matplotlib can power full-scale business intelligence\n",
        "\n",
        "Going forward, this project can evolve into a fully interactive web dashboard using tools like Streamlit or Plotly Dash, or even integrate predictive modeling to forecast future revenue based on historical trends.\n",
